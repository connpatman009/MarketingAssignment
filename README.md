You are the marketing of City Cycles, a bike shop based in Pittsburgh. You have just been tasked with developing an advertising campaign to increase profits for the company. There are several advertising strategies you can deploy, such as TV commercials or social media campaigns. Below is a summary of the strategies, their costs per neighborhood, and some information about what age group it is most effective for (considering more demographic information but trying to avoid biases when choosing effectiveness). The probability of somebody seeing the advertisement AND purchasing a bike is 5%. The probability of somebody not seeing the advertisement AND purchasing a bike is 0.1%. Each bike can be sold for $300. (Should work on creating a better problem that would mean needing to use a probability table or probability tree).

Pittsburgh is full of diverse neighborhoods each with its own unique makeup. You can gather demographic information for each neighborhood through publicly available data. You will need to determine which advertising strategies to use to gain the most profit for the company.


AdCampaign.py will be the driver of the program. It will call methods from Advertising.py, which is where the main work for this assignment takes place. You will need to implement the __init__ and calculations methods to complete the assignment. More details about what you need to do with each assignment can be found in the code itself.
